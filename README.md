# StevenBlack's filtered hosts file

This script combines my own hosts file with StevenBlack's huge *fakenews+gambling+social* hosts file.

Removes the default localhost config and adds my own config.

Removes Reddit and Twitter from it, that way it's accessible.

Automatically applies the new  hosts file.

If you want to use it yourself, you have to change the paths in *hosts.sh* and change the localhost config in the *filter*.
